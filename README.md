# STOP WATCH APP

# Assignment
Build a stop watch app including a lap function

# Functions
- Start
- Lap
- Stop
- Reset
- Continue
- Share (Optional)

# Steps
1.User should be able to use Start function/button to start the timer

2.While the timer is running, the Lap function button should be used to show elapsed time to that point 

3.User should be able to Stop the running time 

4.User can choose to Continue from where it stops or Reset the timer to start

5.User can Share the elapsed time stop with friends on different social media platforms


# How it works

i). 	When user starts the timer the Lap, Stop and Reset buttons pops up and take up the space of the start button

ii). 	When user uses the Lap button, the elapsed time to that point should be recorded and shown just beneath the running timer. Subsequent clicking of the lap function will show those longer time measurements, and when you finally click stop, the total time elapsed is shone.

iii). 	When user stops the timer the Continue and Share buttons pops up and up the space of Stop and Lap respectively while the Reset button still maintains its position and performs its function (i.e resets the timer to the start)

# Issues Faced 
1.  DOM manipulation 
2.  Collaborating with and operating git hub. 
3.  Adjusting the milliseconds counter


#  Feedback 
The assignment was a workable one that helped us implement what we have learnt so far....
